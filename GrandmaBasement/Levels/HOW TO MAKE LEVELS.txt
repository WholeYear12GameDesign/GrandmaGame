For each level statt with making a scene called dome 1 or something similar and attach the Dome.gd script to it then place first screen and the other nodes that are found in the Dome_1 scene
without these the levels will just not work

When placing the load screen make sure it is around 30px away from the exit
The offset is used to place the screen away from the current one and should only have the same values as the viewport resolution
such as (1920,0) (0, -1080) (0,1080) one value should always be 0 becuase screens shouldnt be able to be placed diagonally

add checkpoints at each exit of a screen so that the player wont have to restart from the start of the level
make sure the screens are atleast a bit of a challenge otherwise the checkpoints will make it too easy to beat the game

put the path of the screen in the next_scene value 
in the final screen put a teleporter and put whatever scene you want the player to be teleported to
